About This Project:
In this project I created my own Command Line Shell called ./crash. The outermost layer of the operating system kernel is called the shell. In Unix-based systems, the shell is generally a command line interface. Most Linux distributions ship with bash as the default (there are several others: csh, ksh, sh, tcsh, zsh). 

What is a Command Line Shell:
A shell is a computer program that produces a command line interface that allows you to enter commands and control your computer. I created a command line shell that supports basic functions like built in commands (cd, comments, !, !!, and scripting mode), background jobs, signal handling, variable expansion, history, and pipes and redirection.

To compile and run:

```bash
make
./crash
```

## Testing

To execute the test cases, use `make test`. To pull in updated test cases, run `make testupdate`. You can also run a specific test case instead of all of them:

```
# Run all test cases:
make test

# Run a specific test case:
make test run=4

# Run a few specific test cases (4, 8, and 12 in this case):
make test run='4 8 12'
```
